    <h3 class="headers ingredient-header">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingred-list">
        <li>5 chicken breasts, flattened to 1/4 inch thickness</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional for extra flavor)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or clarified butter for frying</li>
        <li>Lemon wedges for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="headers steps-header">Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In an empty bowl, mix the flour with salt, pepper, and paprika.
        <li>In another empty bowl, whisk the egg.</li>
        <li>In a deep plate, or another empty mixing bowl, pour in the breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Tap each chicken breast dry with a paper towel, and then coat in the seasoned flour, ensuring an even layer.</li>
        <li>Dip the floured chicken into the egg bowl, making sure it's completely covered.</li>
        <li>Press the chicken into the panko breadcrumbs to coat. For extra crispiness, repeat the egg and breadcrumb steps to double coat.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil or butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. The oil should shimmer but not smoke.</li>
        <li>Fry the schnitzel for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Adjust the heat as needed to avoid burning.</li>
        <li>Transfer the schnitzel to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately with lemon wedges and your favorite sides, such as french fries or a mediterranean salad.</li>
    </ol>
